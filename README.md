# Analyzing Wine Quality using R
In this project I used R and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers,
and anomalies.

## What did I need to install?
In order to complete the project, I need to install R. After installing R,I downloaded and installed R Studio.
Finally, I need to install a few packages.Udacity recommend opening R Studio and installing the following packages using
the command line.


install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = T) 
install.packages("knitr", dependencies = T)
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = T)

My whole work flow contains the follwing steps :

##  Choose your Data Set and get organised
First, I chose a data set i.e Red Wine Quality from the [Data Set Options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEcwltBMlRYZT-l699-71TzInWfk4W9q5rTCSvDVMpc/pub?embedded=true).
My project include the files in order

* The RMD file that contains the analysis, final plots and summary, and reflection (in that order)
* The HTML file that will be knitted from your RMD file
* The data set you used (which you will only submit if you found your own data set)

## Explore and document your anaysis

This is the fun part. Start exploring your data!
I had to document my exploration and analysis in an RMD file. That file had to be formatted in markdown and should contain (in order):

### A stream-of-consciousness analysis and exploration of the data.

a. Headings and text should organize your thoughts and reflect your analysis as you explored the data.

b. Plots in this analysis do not need to be polished with labels, units, and titles; these plots are exploratory (quick and dirty).
They should, however, be of the appropriate type and effectively convey the information you glean from them.

c. You can iterate on a plot in the same R chunk, but you don’t need to show every plot iteration in your analysis.
### A section at the end called “Final Plots and Summary”

You will select three plots from your analysis to polish and share in this section. The three plots should show different trends and
should be polished with appropriate labels, units, and titles (see the Project Rubric for more information).

### A final section called “Reflection”

This should contain a few sentences about your struggles, successes, and ideas for future exploration on the data set.

## Knit your RMD file
I knitted RMD file that should not be one long chunk of R code. It contains text and plots interspersed throughout. The goal is to give
the person reading the file insight into what I was thinking as I explored your data. My knitted html file can be viwed [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kamal11k/Analyzing-Wine-Quality-using-R/blob/master/projectTemplate.html)
